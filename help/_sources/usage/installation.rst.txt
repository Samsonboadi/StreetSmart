Installation
============

The installation of the QGIS Street Smart plugin is done through the standard
QGIS plugin installation mechanism. In the Plugins menu, go to the 'Manage and
Install plugins...' option.

   Select the 'Install from ZIP' option and go to the folder where the zip file
   is located.

Once the plugin is installed, check if the plugin is enabled. The plugin can be
found in the installed plugins tab. The checkbox in front of the StreetSmart
plugin must be checked.

   Enable the plugin in the installed plugins tab.

Finally, restart QGIS so that you have all the functionality of the plugin
available.

Prerequisites
-------------

For the moment, the plugin only works on Windows 10. The following verions of
QGIS are supported: 3.10.14 LTS, 3.16.10 LTS, and 3.20.2.

To use the Street Smart plugin, three Python modules must be available in the
QGIS environment, namely: cefpython3, geojson and shapely. An administrator can
install these modules. If these are not yet installed, the plugin will install
the modules when it first runs. The user must have the necessary rights to
install these modules.

The module cefpython3 needs Python version 2.7 or a Python version between 3.4
and 3.9 both included. On Windows, this is not an issue because a valid python
version is installed together with QGIS.

The plugin makes use of the StreetSmart API. Therefore, to view the CycloMedia
Imagery, a license with CycloMedia is needed.

Proxy Server
------------

The plugin can be used behind a proxy server. Once installed, the plugin must
have access to the following URIs:

- unpkg.com
- cdnjs.cloudflare.com
- atlas.cyclomedia.com
- atlas1.cyclomedia.com
- atlas2.cyclomedia.com
- atlas3.cyclomedia.com
- atlas4.cyclomedia.com
- streetsmart.cyclomedia.com
